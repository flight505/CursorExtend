Below is a detailed plan that outlines how to build your new tool using Oclif in TypeScript/Node.js. It explains which parts we can reuse or adapt from your existing deep research agent code and how we can modify the prompts and functionality to focus on code architecture analysis using public sources (web search, StackOverflow, GitHub issues).

---

## 1. Technology and Framework Choice

- **CLI Framework:**  
  We’ll build the tool using [Oclif](https://oclif.io/), a robust CLI framework from Salesforce that works great with TypeScript and Node.js. This aligns with the existing MCP ecosystem (e.g., code-research-mcp-server and awesome-cursor-mpc-server) which are implemented in TypeScript/Node.js.

- **Library Ecosystem:**  
  - Use Node.js versions of **LangChain** (e.g., [langchainjs](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs)) and similar libraries for workflow management (comparable to LangGraph).  
  - Leverage native Node.js libraries or lightweight wrappers for public APIs (e.g., GitHub API, "StackOverflow - not API", and a web search API).

## 2. Key Modules and Functional Areas

### A. Guided Setup & Configuration Module
- **Functionality:**  
  - Interactive wizard using a library like [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) to guide users through creating/customizing `.mdc` files and configuring MCP server settings.
- **Outcome:**  
  - Generate configuration files (in JSON/YAML) for both Cursor project rules and MCP connections.

### B. Deep Research Agent for Code Architecture Analysis
- **Adaptation of Existing Code:**  
  - Reuse the general plan-and-execute pattern from your Python-based deep research agent.
  - **Modifications:**  
    - Replace financial analysis prompts with those that focus on code architecture: analyze module dependencies, identify hotspots, review documentation and issues on GitHub, StackOverflow, and web search results.
    - Update system prompts to target “Code Architecture Analysis” rather than financial queries.
- **Functionality:**  
  - **Planning Phase:** Generate a multi-step plan to explore the codebase architecture.
  - **Execution Phase:** For each step, query public sources:
    - **Web Search:** Use a free web search API (e.g., Google Custom Search or Bing Search APIs).
    - **StackOverflow:** Query the StackExchange API for relevant discussions.
    - **GitHub Issues:** Use GitHub’s REST API to fetch issues related to the codebase or similar projects.
  - **Replanning Phase:** Adjust the plan based on partial results and guide the agent until a final architectural analysis is produced.

### C. ML Workflow & Data Pipeline Manager Module
- **Functionality:**  
  - For Python/data science projects, provide commands to set up and monitor ML pipelines.
  - Integrate with popular ML frameworks and offer lightweight visualization (this module can be developed incrementally).

### D. Modular Plugin Architecture
- **Functionality:**  
  - Design the CLI to be modular so that additional tools can be easily added.
  - Use a standardized interface (TypeScript interfaces) for each plugin.
  - Create a repository or marketplace where community modules can be contributed.
- **Outcome:**  
  - Users can extend the tool with additional functionalities (e.g., security scanning, automated refactoring).

## 3. Development Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Environment & Architecture Setup**
- **Select Technology Stack:**  
  - Use TypeScript with Oclif for the CLI.
  - Set up a project structure that separates core functionality, plugins, and configuration.
- **Research & Prototype:**  
  - Explore the existing MCP server projects (e.g., [code-research-mcp-server](https://github.com/nahmanmate/code-research-mcp-server) and [awesome-cursor-mpc-server](https://github.com/kleneway/awesome-cursor-mpc-server)) to understand their architecture.
  - Prototype basic MCP endpoints in TypeScript.

### **Phase 2: Develop Core CLI & Guided Setup**
- **CLI Foundation:**  
  - Build the initial CLI skeleton using Oclif.
  - Implement commands for configuration setup (e.g., `setup:mdc`, `setup:mcp`).
- **Guided Wizard:**  
  - Create interactive prompts using Inquirer.js for configuring project rules and MCP server settings.

### **Phase 3: Deep Research Agent Module**
- **Re-Implement Workflow:**  
  - Port the plan-and-execute logic from your Python code into TypeScript.
  - Modify prompts to focus on code architecture:
    - Example: “Analyze the dependency graph of the codebase by searching GitHub issues and StackOverflow discussions related to module coupling and refactoring strategies.”
- **Integrate Public APIs:**  
  - Add modules to query web search, StackOverflow, and GitHub issues.
  - Combine the results to generate a cohesive architectural analysis.
  
### **Phase 4: ML Workflow & Plugin System**
- **ML Module:**  
  - Implement basic commands to monitor and manage ML pipelines.
- **Plugin System:**  
  - Define a standardized interface for additional tools.
  - Develop a plugin loader that automatically discovers and integrates new modules.

### **Phase 5: Testing, Documentation & Community Integration**
- **Testing:**  
  - Write unit tests and integration tests for each module.
  - Beta test the CLI tool within a controlled group.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Provide detailed setup guides, command references, and contribution guidelines.
- **Community Engagement:**  
  - Set up a GitHub repository for community-contributed plugins and feedback.

### **Phase 6: Deployment & Iteration**
- **Beta Release:**  
  - Launch an initial beta release for early adopters.
- **Iterate Based on Feedback:**  
  - Refine prompts, API integrations, and plugin architecture based on user feedback.
- **Official Launch:**  
  - Finalize core features and prepare for a stable release.

## Final Recommendations

- **Use Oclif** as the primary CLI framework to leverage a modern, extensible command-line experience.
- **Develop in TypeScript/Node.js** to align with existing MCP server projects, ensuring smooth integration and community collaboration.
- **Focus initially on the guided setup and deep research agent modules**—then expand with ML workflow management and a plugin system.
- **Modify existing prompts and workflows** to target code architecture analysis using public APIs (web search, StackOverflow, GitHub issues) rather than financial analysis.

This approach gives you a clear, modular path forward and ensures that the resulting tool not only simplifies MCP and .mdc configuration for Cursor but also delivers valuable insights into code architecture, ultimately serving a wide range of developers.
